## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Federica.
I live in the beautiful Hudson Valley with my dog Bowie.

### If you picture a Venn diagram of Strategic thinking, Design and user focus, and technical chops, I like to think that I belong in that middle intersection.

I am a product leader with a design background who has spent more than a decade leading product teams. I've brought products to market from genesis to maturity in the startup, corporate, and government sectors. Through it all, what remains is my passion for using technology to build mission-driven products that have a net positive impact. 

Recently, I finished my Masters in Computer Science, so I've been brushing up my technical chops too!

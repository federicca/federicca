I am a product leader with a design background who has spent more than a decade leading product teams. I've brought products to market from genesis to maturity in the startup, corporate, and government sectors. Through it all, what remains is my passion for using technology to build mission-driven products that have a net positive impact. 

Recently, I finished my Masters in Computer Science, so I've been brushing up my technical chops too!

I also research fairness and ethics in AI and like to speak publicly about this and other human-tech topics around the world.
